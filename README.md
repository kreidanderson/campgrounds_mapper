## Goal
We want the user to see a list of the top campsites per state from a trusted source, so that they can spend less time scrolling and researching, and more time out in the wilderness. 

## Process
- We began by locating all the data we wanted to use in the website
- From there, we created all the folders necessary
- The first code added to the project was the map which we designed around.
- We used several technologies to do this, see below:

## Technologies Used
- Mysql 
- Express
- Express Handlebars
- Google Maps API
- NPS API (National Parks)

## Issues
- We struggled with mastering google maps
- We wanted to have the ratings of each campground append below the map but didn't have enough time

## Future Developments
- Tie in National Park search with nearby campsites
- Search National Parks by state, and insert into map
- Create search input for the map
- Improve zoom and marker click capabilities with the Google API
- Allow users to leave a detailed review, and add photos of their trips
